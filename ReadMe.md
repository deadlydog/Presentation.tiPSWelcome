# tiPS Welcome Presentation

This repo contains the slide deck for the presentation I gave to [the Pacific PowerShell User Group on June 12, 2024](https://www.meetup.com/pacific-powershell-user-group/events/301530283/).
The presentation was recorded, but unfortunately the audio was not captured so the video was scrapped.

The presentation is an overview of [the tiPS PowerShell module](https://github.com/deadlydog/PowerShell.tiPS), and discussions around some of the lessons I learned while developing it.

I gave a much more trimmed down version of the presentation at [the Research Triangle PowerShell User Group on November 6, 2024](https://www.meetup.com/research-triangle-powershell-users-group/events/304331467/).
You can [watch that recording on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp3sOKTnGrE).

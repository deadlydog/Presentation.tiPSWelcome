# tiPS Welcome Presentation

This repo contains the slide deck for the presentation I gave to the Pacific PowerShell User Group on June 12, 2024.
The presentation was recorded, but unfortunately the audio was not captured so the video was scrapped.

The presentation is an overview of [the tiPS PowerShell module](https://github.com/deadlydog/PowerShell.tiPS), and discussions around some of the lessons learned while developing it.

# tiPS Welcome Presentation

This repo contains the slide deck for the presentation I gave to the Pacific PowerShell User Group on June 12, 2024.

The presentation is an overview of [the tiPS PowerShell module](https://github.com/deadlydog/PowerShell.tiPS), and discussions around some of the lessons learned while developing it.
